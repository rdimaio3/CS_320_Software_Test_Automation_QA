How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by utilizing a test-driven design mindset. Testing must always be a priority when creating software and should not be treated as an afterthought. Continuous integration and contiuous delivery (or continuous deployment) (CI/CD) allows for testing to always be integrated into the actual programming, rather than being thought of as a separate process that occurs after the software has already been written.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs starts with good user interviews or other techniques to elicit requirements. The user must always be the focus of the software we write. If we create a beautiful program with efficient code and impressive features, that won't matter if it doesn't fulfill the user's needs. We must always be checking that our software is meeting the user's requirements at every step.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software with the user's needs in mind first and foremost. As stated above, the user's needs are paramount. We must ensure that every feature we add or change we make is in line with what the user or customer wants. Once we have a good grasp on the user's needs, we should focus on the technical side of our code, making sure that each part of our program passes the tests we have written for them. There must be great care when writing the tests as well, making sure we are testing for the proper functionality, while keeping the user's needs in mind.
